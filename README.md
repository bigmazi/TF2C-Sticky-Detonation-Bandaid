# TF2C-Sticky-Detonation-Bandaid
Fixes bug when Demoman can't detonate stickies

Stickybombs won't detonate if something other than Stickybomb Launcher is active and the altfire button was pressed before the arm time is over - until the user switches the weapon or reissue the altfire button.

The plugin replicates the latter solution whenever the pointed problem occurs.
